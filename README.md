# @ts-reactive-forms

MonoRepo for @ts-reactive-forms

The idea is having a core of reactive forms utils inspired by angular to work with forms in many situations: VanillaJS, Vue, React and others.
The only one that doesn't make sense is Angular (of course).
At this time I implemented a Vue directive to work with formControls that I just need to improve by having a look at Angular's directives.
