A library to have the power of reactive forms (these are a strict reproduction of Angular ones, taken from v 15.2.x).
Just note that at this time we don't have adapters for the various frameworks.
I'm using this lib in a Vue project and I will add the Vue directive under a scoped package

## Getting Started

or if you have node installed you can use the following command

```

## Running the tests

There are no actual tests, but the environment is ready to be run with `npm run test`
